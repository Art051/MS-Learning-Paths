Logging progression through Microsoft's Learning Paths and tutorials.

Each folder relates to a separate learning path/standalone module.

The learning facility on their website has an inbuilt code editor to run answers to challenges in, I started by using that and then switched to VS Community edition/VS Code in order to save my work.
Some of the first few modules I did are missing due to this.
